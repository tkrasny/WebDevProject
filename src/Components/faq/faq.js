            <h4>What's the difference between betting on the spread and the money line?</h4>
            <p>Betting on the spread means betting on the number of points a team is going to win or lose by. For
            example, if you bet on the Giants +6.5 against the Steelers, you are wagering that the Giants will lose by
            6 points or less or win the game. If you bet on the Steelers -6.5 to beat the Giants, you are betting
            on the Steelers to win by at least 7 points. Betting on the money line simply means betting on who is going
            to win a game outright. The key difference here is that you would get better odds betting on the Giants
            because they are the underdog in the game, and betting on the Steelers money line would give you less value
            because they are heavy favorites.</p>
